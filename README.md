# YOCA

I know this concept isn't new—I am copying someone doing 1000 days—but I wanted to set something for myself that is a good start, so One Year of Code is my goal. This will not be my work project but my learning something new and building something new, and I will put it out on a website, Twitter, and GitHub.

I will post a quick summary and a full write-up of what I did on this website each day.

* The day's goal?
* What was built?
* What should I think about next?

I think I can start by building out a site for this project, then work on some of my other projects, such as the blog platform, and see where that takes me.

Another challenge I will put on myself is to develop on more than one platform. I will still use my normal development patterns, but I will use my Mac or Linux computer to do the full development. This way, I will have more experience using those platforms for the type of coding I want to use.

While I plan on doing something every day, the write-up may not happen on that day. I may also do something mid-day, or other times, it may be late at night after midnight. But I will count a day between when I sleep. My work project will take priority, so if a few days seem lacking, that may be why.
